Original question: Access to nutritional programs and the relationship to heart disease, obesity and mortality rates
The team landed on the focus being on heart disease in rural areas. After some research, I propose revising the question to the instances of heart disease and its relationship to diet and exercise. 

Risk factors for developing heart disease include:

•	Poor diet. A diet that's high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol can contribute to the development of heart disease.
NOTE:	This risk factor can be linked to the access of nutrition

•	Obesity. Excess weight typically worsens other risk factors.
•	Physical inactivity. Lack of exercise also is associated with many forms of heart disease and some of its other risk factors, as well.

I believe we can create visualizations that speak to the risk factors in rural vs non rural. Considerations still pending include demographics
•	AHA 2019 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics

	I cant seem to find a link to raw data.
